## Features
1. Decentralized Architecture: The application is built on decentralized principles, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced security, transparency, and trustlessness.
2. Ethereum Integration: Smart contracts developed in Solidity are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and connected using Metamask.
3. React.js Frontend: The frontend interface is developed using React.js, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
4. Pinata Integration: Pinata is used for uploading images, ensuring decentralized file storage and retrieval.
5. Remix.ethereum: Remix is used to deploy the smart contracts

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/venu630/Blockchain_Final_Project.git

    cd Blockchain_Final_Project
    npm install

## Deploy the Smart Contract:
1. Download the Smart Contract file and create a new file in remix.etherium.
2. Paste the dowloaded file in remix.etherium and run compile. 
3. Deploy the smart contract and test the functionalities.

## Update the abi file and transaction id:
1. Download the abi file from smart contract and update the abi file in the code.
2. Update the transaction id with the updated transaction id of the deployed smart contract.

## Pinata configuration
1. Creata a new account in Pinata.
2. Create new API key and Secret Key and paste them in the code base.

## Usage
    npm run start

## Deployment
1. Smart Contracts Deployment: Before deploying smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain, ensure proper testing and auditing. 
2. Frontend Deployment: Deploy the React.js frontend to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for accessibility to users.
