# Decentralized E-Commerce Website

## Overview
This project is a decentralized e-commerce website built using React.js for the front end and Solidity for smart contract development. The project utilizes Pinata for uploading images, ensuring decentralized and secure file storage.


## Features
a. Decentralized Architecture: The application is built on decentralized principles, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced security, transparency, and trustlessness.

b. Ethereum Integration: Smart contracts developed in Solidity are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and connected using Metamask.

c.React.js Frontend: The frontend interface is developed using React.js, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.

d. Pinata Integration: Pinata is used for uploading images, ensuring decentralized file storage and retrieval.

e. Remix.ethereum: Remix is used to deploy the smart contracts

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/venu630/Blockchain_Final_Project.git

2. Install dependencies:
    cd Blockchain_Final_Project
    npm install

3. Deploy the Smart Contract:
a. Download the Smart Contract file and create a new file in remix.etherium.

b. Paste the dowloaded file in remix.etherium and run compile. 

c. Deploy the smart contract and test the functionalities.

4. Update the abi file and transaction id:
a. Download the abi file from smart contract and update the abi file in the code.

b. Update the transaction id with the updated transaction id of the deployed smart contract.

## Pinata configuration
a. Creata a new account in Pinata.

b. Create new API key and Secret Key and paste them in the code base.

## Usage
    npm run start

## Deployment
a. Smart Contracts Deployment: Before deploying smart contracts to the Ethereum blockchain, ensure proper testing and auditing. 

b. Frontend Deployment: Deploy the React.js frontend to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for accessibility to users.
